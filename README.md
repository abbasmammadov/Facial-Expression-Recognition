# Facial-Expression-Recognition

Final Project : CS376 - Machine Learning

Human facial expressions reveal a lot of crucial, hidden, information, such as their emotional states
and intentions. Recognizing the emotions of a person will help us understand the wishes and behavior
of people. Considering the importance of interaction between humans and computers, it becomes
necessary to develop a classifier to determine a personâ€™s emotion through their facial expression.
Even though distinguishing the fundamental expressions by computers has been developed with
a level of higher accuracy in simple environments, there is still room to improve on in terms of
classifying emotions from facial expressions in a real world environment. Thus we aim to create an
efficient, applicable model to work in real world environments, that classifies emotion based on facial
expressions; independent of the age, ethnicity, or the appearance of a person.
